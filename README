# gpx2imgseq

**Under developement**

Currently it reads "input.gpx" and creates image sequences for `speed` and `course`.
Each image is build of three "layer": Background, Gauge and Arrow but in different order.
The Arrow-Image is rotated depending of `speed` or `course` from the GPX-File.

Speed
- Background
- Arrow
- Gauge

Course
- Background
- Gauge
- Arrow


## TODO

Lots of things.
- Other arrtibuts of GPX like `time`, `lat`, `lon` and `elevation`. Maybe an Map depending on the Trackpoints.
- Make it configurable: Commandline options or Configfile ?
- Collect dependencies
