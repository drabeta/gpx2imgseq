# !! NEVER CHANGE THE GIT-HISTORY !!


# normal workflow
- edit your files, add some, delete some.
- git status                                  # view modifications
- git add -A     or     git add <file>        # add files to staging-area
- - git reset <file>                          #   remove file from staging-area
- git commit -m "description of changes"      # creates an commitment
-                                             #   revert commit
- git pull                                    # ALLWAYS: get changes from server other have made
- git push                                    # pushes commit to current branch 


# undo mistakes
- git status                                  # view to be sure
- - git checkout <badfile>                    #   get the goodfile from server again   or
- - git checkout <branch>                     #   get the hole branche from server


# correcting commit message (not pushed)
- git commit -m "wrong message"               # create commit with wrong message
- git commit --amend -m "new message"         # change the message of last commit before push


# adding file to commit (not pushed)
- git commit --amend                          # interactive editor starte (vim) just(?) :wq


# remove file from git
- git rm <file>                               # delete file from filesystem and git-repo
- git rm --cached <file>                      # delete file from git-repo only


# rename/move file
- git mv <file> <new-name>                    # renames file to new-name
- git mv <file> <path/file>                   # moves file into path-folder


# creating a new branch
- git pull                                    # update current (not branch on outdated files)
- git branch new-branchname                   # just creates the branch
- git push -u origin new-branchname           # pushes branch to server


# working in branch
- git checkout new-branchname                 # ! switch to branch to work in
- edit files, add,commit
- git push


# merge a branch to an other
- git checkout main-branch                    # switch to main-branch(target)
- git pull                                    # get letest from server
- git merge new-branchname                    # merge new into main
                    # commit needed ??
- git push                                    # transfer new main to server
- git branch -d new-branchname                # delete from local
- git push origin -d new-branchname           # delete from server
